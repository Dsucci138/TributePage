      <h2>Timeline of Diogene's Life</h2>
      <p>Much is known about Diogenes, he was a man forging his own path and route of philosophy especially for the time. He rejected convential desires for the time in favor of a very humble lifestyle instead. Almost all of his life he lived in a large wine cask and owned no personal possessions. He used this moderate lifestyle as a means to critisize the values of people and institutions of the time.</p>
      <p><i>"People who talk well but do nothing are like musical instruments; the sound is all they have to offer"  ~Diogenes</i></p>
